# Regression-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Wine-Quality-Prediction
Linear Regression Machine Learning Model from scratch (only numpy and matplotlib). This model has 12 input variables and one target. By utilizing gradient descent during the back propagation process, I adjust the weights and biases to effectively train the model. By doing data preprocessing, I was able to eliminate the input variables with very low correlation with the target variable, and this helped increase the accuracy of the model, both for the training and the testing set. As my first time working with matrices in python, it was a super cool experience and it is my goal now to make a classification machine learning model using neural networks next.
